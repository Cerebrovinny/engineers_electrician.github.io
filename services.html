          Fuse-board upgrades</h4>
          <h5 class="section-title mb-4 text-black">
          <p>Many homes still have old-style fuse boxes installed with their outdated fuses, offering little or no protection against electrocution.  Renewing your old fuse board has a number of benefits, including improved safety and electrical efficiency. By upgrading to an advanced fuse box (Consumer unit), LGW Electrical Services can  ensure that you have an essential residual-current device (RCD) that will provide additional protection. With the inclusion of mini circuit breakers, they offer crucial protection to each circuit throughout your home, in case of danger from an electrical fault or electricity surge.
            We provide a complete fuse board replacement service. Our qualified electricians can professionally install a new fuse board or replace your old one, all to current British Standards. Before replacement takes place, our electricians inspect and carry out any required maintenance on your existing fuse board.
            We can also fit or repair RCDs and circuit breakers, fit fuses and offer a complete re-wiring service for all types of fuse boards.
            All fuse boards we replace are in line with 17th edition regulations.
            
            Full testing and inspection (Part-P certification)

              Testing and Inspecting</h4>
              <h5 class="section-title mb-4 text-black">
              <p>Testing & Inspections
                There are many reasons why you might need your premises, or an electrical item, to undergo testing and inspection. It could be for a change of ownership or use, for a landlord’s inspection, for insurance purposes or just for your own peace of mind.
                Whatever the reason, we provide full electrical testing and inspection services for our domestic, commercial and industrial customers.  
                As all electrical installations deteriorate with age and use, it’s essential that they are regularly maintained - ensuring that the safety of others is not at risk.  According to the Health and Safety Executive, more than 2,000 fires a year are caused by faulty electrical appliances. So legislation exists to protect the interests of employers, employees and tenants, as well as users of portable electrical equipment, to keep electrical installations in safe working order.
                Every property should have its electrical installation tested and certified regularly. A periodic electrical inspection report or now known as a EICR will reveal any potential hazards within the installation, identify any defective work, as well as highlighting any lack of earthing or bonding whilst continuing to test its fixed wiring. This includes checking fuse or circuit breaker ratings, and testing the RCDs to make sure they trip under fault conditions.
                If you are a landlord, it’s your responsibility to make sure that the property you are renting out is fit for purpose, which includes electrical wiring.  An electrical inspection report is required at each change of tenancy, or every 5 years whichever is sooner, to verify that the previous tenant has not damaged or changed the electrical system in any way. [We are Napit Approved Electrical Inspectors]
                An inspection report is recommended at least every 5 years, for homeowners and businesses.
                 
                Our experienced electricians offer the follow testing and inspection services:
                Part P certification
                Electrical installation certificates
                Minor works installation certificates
                Periodic electrical inspection report (EICR)
                Home buyers electrical survey
                Visual condition report
                Portable appliance testing (PAT testing)</p></h5></div>

                  <p>
                    Whatever your EV charging requirements are, count on us at to help ! Our domestic and commercial electrical services are available in and around Warwickshire, Oxfordshire, Glouceshire and the surrounding counties</p></h5>
                  <p><h6>
                    
We are approved installers of EV chargers with the Office for Low Emission Vehicles OLEV.

The benefits of having a dedicated charging station
Instead of using a domestic socket to plug into and charge your car, a dedicated Charging Station will communicate with your vehicle whilst plugged in which is safer, reducing the risk of overheating and other faults.
Charge times are greatly reduced when using one of our approved Car Charging Points, customers report a charge time reduced by 30 to 60%.

Electric Vehicle Home charge Scheme

With the increase in demand for Electric Vehicles, grants are available from the Government for approved Car Chargers installed by authorised and registered companies with funding in the form of a grant which covers upto 75% of the installation cost or a maximum of £500.00  

Our team provide a hassle free experience from start to finish, completing the paperwork involved with the grant, and providing a walkthrough on how to make the most out of your new Car Charger.

The works involved are useally minor and our qualified Electricians complete works in a timely and professional manor. 
If you need more information on domestic Car Chargers then please call 07956 289458 where we will be more than happy to answer your questions and arrange a site visit to suit your

Workplace Charging Scheme

have announced the introduction of funding to commercial premises for the installation of Charging Points and a grant of £300 can be claimed per point up to a maximum of 20 points.
The applicant of the grant will be granted a voucher which can be redeemed and installed by LGW Electrical. Unlike the Home Scheme, commercial premises do not necessarily need to have an Electric Vehicle on site. However, to obtain a grant, a demand for the EV point must be justified in the initial application.
The process of applying for a Voucher couldn’t be simpler. Once you have completed the application form and you have been successful, your Voucher will be emailed to you. You then have 4 months for an Approved Installer to come to your site and install your Charge Point.</h6></p>
